SAXS Task 2 

SDLs will be very imported parameters for analysis (sanity check/fitting with random numbers will give you random solution)
Estimate SLD
Micells --> find a way what geometry it is (try different combinations x^2 to look at the fit)
Task1 pdf like Task2 

Task 2:
radius of Micell (aspect ratio, geometry, SLD)
SLD of tail fix (does not change a lot), Head SLD changes more because of Water.

FWScatering: I(q --> 0) = a * n <V**2> <delta SLD**2)
I(q --> 0) = see picture (practicall tipp. in task 2 we do not care so much about absolut/relativ scale. Dont fix it. do it temporaryly)

For SLD dont count the Salt 

chem spider to look up for example density (if you just have one source). In case of SDS there was no result so we chose Dodecan-1-ide to approximate the SLD of the tail.
go properties and go down 
density of the tail ~0.75

Now the same for the head --> sulfate [Ai value 1.8] head is harder because water will contribute to the SLD. It will be between SLD of water and calcuted value of Head.

Open sasview documentation --> model explanation --> surch for the right modle

first try with core shell modle backgroud value 0.008 min 0.007 max 0.009 sds --> sld solvent 9.44; sld shell 50:50 aprox 12 min/max 10-15, sld core 7.1-7.5

radius calculate 12 *1.2 --> put 14 
thikness must be less so ~5 

add polydispersity (not to teh head so not to thinkness) 
fixing means unticking the box 


redo with core shell ellipsoid
x_core is the same as e in Vo
dont change x_polar_change
theta and phi stay unchanged

deside if prolate or oblate be comparing Rmin and Rmax with your calculated lenght 
PRolate e> 1 oblate e<1


draw your structures 
core shell sphere/core shell elipsoide (oblate/prolate)

For the vesicle systhems --> core multi shell/lammela_hg
iii) core shell cylinder (optional for report)

LUV:
Volume Tail --< 950A
Volume of head --> 320A
