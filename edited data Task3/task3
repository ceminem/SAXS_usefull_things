Second  step: Task 3 

look and correlation length model 
second term importend because it referce to the polymer (etha correlation lentgh (mash length)

lorentz exponent --< power law of you polymer (like porod )

Q^n assymtatic behavior of other cluster in your solution 
plot Rg against concentsysthem ration 

semi dilute phase --< rg is getting smaller when concentriation is increased 

cluster is the reason why behavior it shows low 1 range 

etha will take care of the shoulder m will take low q behavior 
cluster can be ingnored as data is bad und we cant see with this resolution --< handle like background 

use hole q range
